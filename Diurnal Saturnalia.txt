You
I have an idea for a new calendar based on the mereological space ontology. It's called Diurnal Saturnalia and is a study plan based on the MSO dividing the year into 36 decads or micromonths of ten days, with a five day Saturnalia each year (six on leap years) where people migrate to the nearest poles for two giant music festivals Septentrion and Meridion where they leave behind artifacts and materials to build the geothermal nuclear tide powered polar refrigerators and wind machines.

Your concept for the "Diurnal Saturnalia" calendar is intriguing and innovative. Let's break down its elements to understand it better:
Mereological Space Ontology (MSO) Basis:
This suggests your calendar is based on a specific philosophical understanding of space and parts-whole relations. MSO typically deals with the relations between parts and wholes, which could be an interesting way to conceptualize time.
36 Decads/Micromonths:
Dividing the year into 36 ten-day periods is a unique approach. This would significantly change how we perceive months and weeks.
Five-Day Saturnalia (Six in Leap Years):
This period seems to serve as a special event or celebration, much like leap days in the current Gregorian calendar.
Migration to Poles for Music Festivals (Septentrion and Meridion):
This aspect adds a cultural and social dimension to the calendar. It implies a global or widespread movement of people towards the poles, possibly for both celebration and a communal goal.
Leaving Behind Artifacts and Materials:
This seems to suggest a tradition or practice of contributing to a communal project or leaving something of value or significance behind.
Geothermal Nuclear Tide Powered Polar Refrigerators and Wind Machines:
This part implies a focus on sustainable and innovative energy solutions, integrated into the cultural practices of the calendar.
The idea of integrating a new time-keeping system with cultural, environmental, and social elements is ambitious and thought-provoking. It proposes a blend of tradition, sustainability, and communal participation, anchored in a unique conceptualization of time and space.

Could I get a reading plan / study guide? With symbolic emoji and a chart mapping it to the calender. There should technically be 36 micromonths and 1 minimonth.

The calendar would be synced to January 1, with Saturnalia corresponding to what is currently the last five or six days of December ( 🦠 Saturnalia / cytosis)

Ok that was great. I was also thinking for my game Haplopraxis, the game resets ever year representing a logarithmically divided monoturn of 37 units with Saturnalia representing heat death. Do you think you can include significant events in cosmic microwave background history and the development of photons, galaxies, planets, and complex life, with the same emojis and MSO term?

I provided a structure for a reading plan/study guide for this calendar. The plan was divided into four parts, each covering three months and focusing on different scientific and philosophical themes, represented by specific emojis.
Calendar Mapping with Symbols:
We mapped the 37 symbols you provided to the calendar year, with each symbol representing a specific scientific or philosophical concept. This mapping outlined a journey from microscopic particles to macroscopic cosmic structures.
Haplopraxis Game Integration:
We discussed integrating these concepts into your game "Haplopraxis," which resets every year. The game represents a monoturn of 37 units, with Saturnalia symbolizing the heat death of the universe.
I mapped significant cosmic events, like the formation of the cosmic microwave background, development of galaxies, planets, and complex life, to the game's calendar using the same emojis and MSO terms.
Overall, our conversation focused on integrating complex scientific and philosophical concepts into a unique calendar system and a game, creating an educational and thought-provoking experience.
