AUTONOMIA UNIVERSITÁRIA E LIBERDADE ACADÊMICA 01

Autonomia universitária e liberdade acadêmica tornaram-se assuntos da ordem do dia no Brasil e no mundo hoje, por muitas e sérias razões. Sentidos e implicações desses termos precisam ser pacientemente revisados e discutidos, sobretudo nesta conjuntura brasileira atual dominada por profundo e doloroso retrocesso político-ideológico. Fazê-lo com cuidado, serenidade, profundidade e racionalidade convém a todos nós que somos parte dessa singular comunidade de diálogo que se chama comunidade universitária. Até porque temos enorme responsabilidade perante os segmentos da sociedade que precisam contar com a educação como fator de emancipação, num contexto de desenvolvimento social e humano tão adverso.

Para isso, como fiz para outros temas e em outras oportunidades, vou compartilhar anotações que estou compilando para um ensaio exploratório, numa perspectiva histórico-crítica de análise retórica, com o objetivo de avaliar o impacto de recentes desdobramentos da crise econômica e política nacional sobre a universidade brasileira e sua autonomia institucional e acadêmica. O ponto de partida foi uma comunicação apresentada na Mesa-Redonda "Universidade e Liberdade Acadêmica", na 71ª Reunião Anual da Sociedade Brasileira para o Progresso da Ciência, realizada na UFMS, em Campo Grande/MS, em 23/7/2019. Estou trabalhando num texto revisado e ampliado com o material produzido no rico debate que se seguiu, ao qual pretendo agregar pontos levantados nesse processo de abertura do tema à discussão neste foro virtual.

Neste ensaio, tomando como ponto de partida esses dois projetos de educação superior, preliminarmente proponho explorar a evolução conceitual das noções de autonomia universitária e liberdade acadêmica. Para isso, em primeiro lugar, comentarei de modo sintético algumas questões etimológicas e conceituais pertinentes às ideias de liberdade acadêmica, autonomia universitária e correlatos, bem como antecedentes históricos de rupturas político-ideológicas ocorridas no início do Século XIX, quando se estabeleceram modelos de educação superior ajustados à modernidade emergente. Na linha central do argumento, em segundo lugar, pretendo discutir como utopia a ideia de que a universidade é um ente jurídico-político dotado de autonomia institucional e liberdade acadêmica plena. Trata-se aqui da ideia-força da Reforma Humboldt, movimento de introdução da pesquisa científica como uma das missões fundamentais das universidades modernas, fortemente associado à filosofia kantiana e ao Romantismo alemão. Em contraste, proponho avaliar como atópica uma noção peculiar de autonomia institucional interna, axial ao modelo de educação superior da Reforma Cabanis, posteriormente incorporada na reforma bonapartista da educação francesa. Variantes desse modelo de ensino superior baseado em faculdades e escolas superiores autônomas, no qual universidades cumprem um papel meramente nominal, foram adotados em muitos países de cultura latina, inclusive no Brasil.

Na sequência, focalizando o processo de redemocratização do nosso país após o regime militar, examino propostas de regulamentação do princípio constitucional da autonomia universitária, formuladas, criticadas, rejeitadas e esquecidas nas últimas décadas. Como exemplo de uma protopia anunciada, mas não realizada, darei destaque especial ao conjunto de propostas elaboradas no primeiro Governo Lula, particularmente entre 2004 e 2006, quando a questão da autonomia institucional assumiu papel central nas propostas de reforma universitária apresentadas pelo Ministério da Educação que, por motivos adiante analisados, proponho designar como Projeto Tarso Genro. Em continuidade, pretendo avaliar o projeto do governo Bolsonaro que, por razões de marketing político, foi intitulado Future-se, pretensa concessão de autonomia administrativa e financeira às universidades brasileiras condicionada à adoção de modelos empresariais de gestão, num contexto de crise econômica, perversão política e distopia social. Por último, a partir da análise desses movimentos históricos, proponho uma apreciação crítica da condição da universidade como instituição social que, para continuar cumprindo sua missão histórica, precisa rever, atualizar e quiçá recriar conceitos herdados de autonomia e liberdade, autonomia institucional e liberdade acadêmica. Retomar a utopia da universidade autônoma numa nova protopia constitui um desafio pertinente, oportuno e urgente, neste momento em que o avanço do ultra-neoliberalismo ameaça diretamente a existência de instituições universitárias públicas em contextos de crescente mercantilização da educação superior, no Brasil e no mundo.

AUTONOMIA UNIVERSITÁRIA E LIBERDADE ACADÊMICA 02

Numa perspectiva histórico-crítica de análise retórica, do ponto de vista metodológico, pretendo conformar uma linha argumentativa para a reflexão proposta, recorrendo à série semântica <utopia-atopia-protopia-distopia> como balizamento para uma abordagem analítica orientada por analogias, correspondências, indícios e contrastes.

Utopia é um termo criado por Thomas Morus no início do século XVI para designar uma sociedade perfeita, existente em lugar-nenhum — daí a origem do termo e seus correlatos denotar uma negação do substantivo Grego τόπος, que significa lugar ou espaço (daí topografia, topologia, tópico etc.). Utopia refere-se, portanto, a um lugar que não existe, maravilhoso, mas fantasioso, uma situação ideal, porém impossível, mero objeto de sonho, desejo e motivação.

A expressão "socialismo utópico" foi empregada por Engels (1880) para designar as propostas políticas de Saint-Simon, Fourier e Owen, diferenciando-as do projeto marxista, ainda em formação naquela época, que seria o socialismo científico. Uma formulação propositalmente oposta foi desenvolvida pelo teórico social alemão Karl Manheim, numa obra intitulada Ideologia e Utopia (Mannheim, 1997), propondo o conceito de utopia como resultante de um movimento de superação da ideologia e a ideia de "mentalidade utópica" para designar um perfil psicosociológico capaz de projetar e realizar a transformação política da sociedade.

Numa perspectiva francamente positiva, quase apologética, o termo utopia foi recuperado por Robert Hutchins, ex-Reitor da Universidade de Chicago, para uma reflexão sobre a missão utópica da universidade no sentido de construir uma sociedade industrial avançada que, em sua opinião, demandaria educação superior para todas e todos (Hutchins, 1953). O conceito de utopia e o papel dos movimentos utópicos no campo da educação foi avaliado do ponto de vista histórico, sociológico e pedagógico por Petitat (2016). Iniciativas recentes de retomada dos estudos sobre as utopias distinguem a utopia reativa, mais no registro do escapismo, da utopia criativa, que poderia no limite indicar que, na cultura ocidental, a universidade tem uma missão histórica transversal (ou oculta) de natureza utópica (Cossette-Trudel, 2016).

Na mesma linhagem etimológica, atopia é um neologismo médico recente (início do século XX) que designa lesão sem localização típica, efeito produzido por processos sistêmicos, sintoma que pode emergir em qualquer parte ou órgão do corpo, como nas hiper-sensibilidades de base alérgica. O termo atopia (ατοπια) etimologicamente implica uma forma alternativa de negação do topos, denotando um fato "sem-lugar", "fora-de-lugar" ou "em qualquer lugar"; seu uso remete ao sentido de "excêntrico", "estranho", bizarro. Foi cunhado pelo filólogo Edward Perry, professor de Grego da Universidade Columbia, a pedido dos dermatologistas Arthur Coca e Robert Cooke para designar o que veio a se chamar de "dermatite atópica" (Leite, Leite & Costa, 2007). Proponho aqui seu emprego, por pura analogia, para designar uma distorção (ou lesão) indeterminada e radical numa dada conjuntura, trajetória ou panorama histórico.

Por outro lado, o termo protopia também configura um neologismo, só que proposto mais recentemente. Recuperando a proposição manheimiana, protopia significa movimento proativo para execução de alguma proposta de criação ou transformação profunda de uma dada realidade; num certo sentido, protopia se refere a projetos realistas e viáveis visando à concretização de uma utopia. Utilizei-o como fecho para uma coletânea de textos críticos e esperançosos sobre o futuro da universidade brasileira que escrevi no contexto do REUNI (Almeida Filho, 2007, p. 167), onde propus adotar a palavra protopia no sentido de

"proposta provocadora, realista, viável, portanto realizável; [...] movimento assumidamente desejante, mobilizador, histórico (no sentido de operado pela ação humana). Por tudo isso, proponho chamá-la de protopia. Ao neologismo se aplica a mesma lógica etimológica do termo utopia. Mas atenção: no lugar da negação, do vazio, temos o prefixo pro, a favor de, na direção de, atuante (como em "pro-ativo")."

O termo protopia foi posteriormente incorporado às discussões mais recentes sobre mundo virtual, ciberpolítica e futurologia por Kevin Kelly, influente fundador da revista Wired, num post em The Technium (2011):

"nosso destino não é nem utopia nem distopia nem status quo, mas protopia. A protopia é um estado melhor hoje do que ontem, embora possa ser apenas um pouco melhor. A protopia é muito mais difícil de visualizar. Como uma protopia contém tantos novos problemas quanto novos benefícios, essa complexa interação de trabalho e ruptura é de difícil previsão. [...] Hoje nos tornamos tão conscientes das desvantagens das inovações e tão desapontados com as promessas das utopias do passado, que agora achamos difícil acreditar mesmo em protopia — que amanhã será melhor do que hoje."

UNIVERSITY AUTONOMY AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM 01
University autonomy and academic freedom have become everyday subjects in Brazil and the world today for many serious reasons. The meanings and implications of these terms must be carefully reviewed and discussed, especially in the current Brazilian situation dominated by profound political and ideological setbacks. This review must be carried out with care, serenity, depth, and rationality, especially as we are part of this unique community called the university community.
The writer shares thoughts and observations regarding the impact of recent developments in Brazil's national economic and political crisis on Brazilian universities and their institutional and academic autonomy. It explores conceptual evolution, historical precedents, and the idea of the university as a legal-political entity with full institutional autonomy and academic freedom. The contrast between different reform models is discussed, along with the process of re-democratization and proposals for regulation of university autonomy in Brazil.
The text examines the proposed Future-se project by the Bolsonaro government, aimed at granting administrative and financial autonomy to Brazilian universities, conditioned on adopting business management models. Finally, the author proposes a critical appreciation of the university as a social institution, in a context of increasing commodification of higher education in Brazil and worldwide.
UNIVERSITY AUTONOMY AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM 02
From a historical-critical perspective of rhetorical analysis, the writer intends to frame an argumentative line for the proposed reflection, using the semantic series <utopia-atopia-protopia-dystopia> as a guide for an analytical approach.
Utopia is a term created by Thomas More in the early 16th century to designate a perfect society that does not exist. Atopia is a medical neologism that designates a lesion without a typical location. Protopia signifies a proactive movement for the execution of a creative or transformative proposal of reality, aiming for the realization of a utopia.
The text explores these concepts in detail, focusing on their historical, sociological, and pedagogical aspects, along with how they relate to the mission of universities in the context of political transformation, virtual worlds, cyber politics, and futurism.

A palavra distopia foi utilizada pela primeira vez por John Stuart Mill em 1868, num discurso irônico endereçado ao Parlamento britânico, demonstrando ceticismo frente a propostas de reforma agrária sem transformação da base econômica que, de tão utópicas, inevitavelmente se fariam "distópicas". O termo tem alcançado grande difusão na literatura de ficção científica ao caracterizar cenários catastróficos de mundos futuros ou distantes, onde se verificam destruição generalizada, caos social, mal-estar, sofrimento e desesperança. Na esteira de A Máquina do Tempo de H.G. Wells (publicado em 1895), de Admirável Mundo Novo de Aldous Huxley (de 1932) e de 1984, obra-prima de George Orwell (publicada em 1948), peças literárias sobre ambientes persecutórios, contextos fascistóides ou regimes totalitários, caracterizados por perversão de valores, violência, suspeita e opressão, tornaram-se paradigmas de distopias sociais (Ashley, 2016). No cinema, inúmeros roteiros foram adaptados de livros e contos que retratam cenários distópicos mais ou menos sombrios e cruéis, como o clássico Blade Runner (1982), de Ridley Scott, além de filmes representativos de distopias políticas que foram produzidos originalmente para o cinema, como o magistral Brazil (1985), concebido e dirigido por Terry Gilliam.

AUTONOMIA UNIVERSITÁRIA E LIBERDADE ACADÊMICA 03

Para melhor orientar essa discussão e enriquecer reflexões tão necessárias quanto urgentes, precisamos antes rever brevemente alguns antecedentes históricos da Universidade, essa instituição milenar de conhecimento que se tornou patrimônio da humanidade.

Instituídas na época medieval tardia, universidades faziam parte de um sistema institucional vinculado à Igreja Católica Romana, com a missão de promover, guardar e proteger a cultura greco-cristã estruturante do ocidente europeu (Ridder-Symoens, 2004). Nessa fase, sob a proteção do Papado e sua poderosa rede episcopal, foram desenvolvidas formas peculiares de autonomia política frente a soberanos e senhores feudais. As universidades tinham governos e tribunais independentes, polícia própria e até cadeias para estudantes libertinos e brigões. O estatuto especial de autonomia das universidades medievais é descrito com precisão por Durham (1989, p.3):
"A diferença fundamental entre as universidades e as escolas das catedrais, que as antecedem, é que as universidades não são instituições eclesiásticas. Também não são órgãos do poder civil. São propriamente instituições da sociedade, reconhecidas pelo Imperador ou pela Igreja. Assim, a construção da universidade implicou a luta por um espaço de autonomia que envolveu sempre uma complexa relação com os poderes constituídos."

No Século XVI, cismas religiosos romperam o vínculo de várias universidades com o Vaticano, principalmente aquelas situadas no centro-norte europeu. Isso deu início a um processo de gradual secularização, desigual em distintas regiões e territórios, que, em certa medida, ainda prossegue em vários contextos institucionais (Gascoigne, 1998). Assim, o conceito de autonomia dessas instituições modificou-se no que se refere à fonte de proteção política e militar, a partir de então repassada para nobres, príncipes e reis que se tornaram patronos de universidades nos territórios sob seu domínio.

Somente após o Renascimento, a Universidade prioriza sua missão pedagógica e se reinventa como instituição formadora de quadros intelectuais e profissionais. Nesse momento, a questão da autonomia com liberdade acadêmica aparece historicamente vinculada a dois projetos antagônicos de educação superior que se consolidaram no Iluminismo (Anderson, 2004). Para um desses projetos, a universidade deve ser lugar de produção de verdades e de formação de produtores de conhecimento (tecnocientífico), num momento crucial de emergência das primeiras formas industriais de produção. No outro projeto, a educação superior aparece como dispositivo institucional destinado à formação de quadros políticos, burocráticos e técnicos para a organização do Estado moderno e para o desenvolvimento econômico, num momento de expansão e consolidação do capitalismo mercantil.

O princípio definidor do primeiro projeto toma a Ciência como a forma mais avançada — e única portadora de validade e legitimidade — para produção de conhecimento nas sociedades modernas. O segundo projeto tem como fundamento o princípio de que a Educação constitui direito fundamental da pessoa humana na medida em que seria matriz de todos os direitos capazes de garantir equidade nas sociedades modernas.

Neste ensaio, tomando como ponto de partida esses dois projetos de educação superior, preliminarmente proponho explorar a evolução conceitual das noções de autonomia universitária e liberdade acadêmica.

Certainly! Since the text you've provided is quite lengthy, I'll translate it in parts. Here's the first part:
The word "dystopia" was first used by John Stuart Mill in 1868, in an ironic speech addressed to the British Parliament, showing skepticism towards agrarian reform proposals without a transformation of the economic base that, being so utopian, would inevitably become "dystopian." The term has gained widespread diffusion in science fiction literature to characterize catastrophic scenarios of future or distant worlds, where widespread destruction, social chaos, discomfort, suffering, and despair are observed. Following "The Time Machine" by H.G. Wells (published in 1895), "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley (from 1932), and "1984," George Orwell's masterpiece (published in 1948), literary pieces on persecutory environments, fascist-like contexts, or totalitarian regimes characterized by perversion of values, violence, suspicion, and oppression became paradigms of social dystopias (Ashley, 2016). In cinema, countless scripts have been adapted from books and stories that portray more or less dark and cruel dystopian scenarios, such as the classic "Blade Runner" (1982) by Ridley Scott, in addition to representative films of political dystopias that were originally produced for cinema, such as the masterful "Brazil" (1985), conceived and directed by Terry Gilliam.
UNIVERSITY AUTONOMY AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM 03
To better guide this discussion and enrich reflections as necessary as they are urgent, we need to briefly review some historical antecedents of the University, this thousand-year-old knowledge institution that has become humanity's heritage.
Instituted in the late medieval period, universities were part of an institutional system linked to the Roman Catholic Church, with the mission of promoting, guarding, and protecting the Greco-Christian culture that structured Western Europe (Ridder-Symoens, 2004). In this phase, under the protection of the Papacy and its powerful episcopal network, peculiar forms of political autonomy were developed against sovereigns and feudal lords. Universities had independent governments and courts, their own police, and even jails for libertine and brawling students. The special statute of autonomy of medieval universities is accurately described by Durham (1989, p.3):
"The fundamental difference between universities and cathedral schools that precede them is that universities are not ecclesiastical institutions. They are also not organs of civil power. They are properly institutions of society, recognized by the Emperor or the Church. Thus, the construction of the university implied a struggle for an autonomy space that always involved a complex relationship with the constituted powers."

I think it relates to another story I am writing:

𝘔𝘪𝘳𝘳𝘰𝘳, 𝘔𝘪𝘳𝘳𝘰𝘳 𝘰𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘞𝘢𝘭𝘭

In a bleak and dimly lit chamber, adorned with cobwebs and relics of forgotten times, there hung an ancient mirror.

A mirror, they said, that held the secrets of the future, a looking glass that could reflect the soul of an era yet to come.

Once, a curious scholar, tormented by visions of automation and machine intellect, sought the mirror's wisdom. 

"Mirror, mirror on the wall," he whispered, trembling with anticipation, "show me the fate of art and labor in the age of machine."

The mirror's surface churned, the glass twisting into grotesque shapes, and then it stilled. Two reflections emerged, side by side, polar opposites yet intertwined.

In one, a world of beauty and efficiency unfolded. Machines worked in harmony with humans, enhancing creativity and freeing them from toil. Art blossomed in ways unimaginable, and prosperity reached new heights.

In the other, a dystopian nightmare loomed. Machines had usurped the role of humans, leaving them jobless and adrift. Creativity withered, replaced by soulless algorithms.

The divide between those who embraced the machines and those who resisted grew into a chasm, and society teetered on the brink of collapse.

The scholar, horrified and entranced, stared into the mirror's depths, unable to look away. The images flickered and intertwined, a dance of hope and despair, progress and regression.

"Mirror, mirror on the wall," he cried, tears in his eyes, "which of these futures will befall?"

The mirror's response was a silent, mocking laugh, a cold reminder that the path between these extremes was yet unwritten, a journey fraught with choices, ethical dilemmas, and the echoes of humanity's eternal struggle with itself.

With a shudder, the scholar stumbled away, haunted by what he had seen, knowing that the mirror's reflections were not prophecies but warnings.

The future was a canvas yet unpainted, and the brush was in the hands of humankind.

The mirror, unfeeling and eternal, returned to its silent vigil, waiting for the next seeker of truth to peer into its depths, where the battle between progress and peril continued to rage.

1The relationship between civilian and military production has changed significantly over the centuries. However, this relationship largely developed, but also became more complex, after the Second World War. There were then several phases. Until the 1970s, there was a successful period of "spontaneous" technological spin-offs arising from military innovations produced during the Second World War. Since the end of the 1980s, the technological initiative attributed to the defence industry has been questioned; it is the end of the spin-off paradigm (Alic et al., 1992). From a purely economic viewpoint, military expenditure also became more difficult to justify. It was between 1970 and 1980 that the term dual use appeared in the United States to justify civilian R&D expenditure on defence budgets, and thus circumvent the rules of the WTO (Uzunidis, Bailly, 2005). Crudely, the duality between the civilian and military spheres evokes the mechanisms relating to the rapprochement of these two spheres.

2Since it appeared, duality experienced a turbulent destiny, both in the academic field and in the operational framework. First, in the operational framework, duality took on different realities. For example, for a defence firm, a dual strategy can just as well mean diversifying its markets towards the civilian sector, based on a technology that operates in the military market, as externalising production of some technologies to suppliers in the civilian field to supply a military market (Mérindol, Versailles 2015). This ambivalence is characteristic of duality and is found in both public policy (Guichard, Heisbourg, 2004), or in technologies (Cowan, Foray, 1995).

3In the area of research there is, then, no clearly established consensus in the economic literature around its definition. However, since the end of the 1980s, duality has become a key subject of study for the defence economy (Gummet, Reppy, 1988; Alic et al., 1992; Cowan, Foray, 1995; Molas-Gallart, 1997; Kulve, Smit 2003; Mérindol, Versailles, 2015, etc.). But if anything, through the diversity of approaches, all of these works reveal the ambivalence of a concept that still needs to be clarified, rather than the unity of a formally defined concept.

4The concept of duality therefore covers a huge and complex system. The aim of this proposition is to analyse the different approaches of duality and to propose a systemic analytical framework of dual technological innovation. This proposition allows us to summarise these approaches and to incorporate all the dimensions that they have helped to highlight in order to present a precise analytical framework for this concept. The question is that of knowing within which institutional area and according to which organisation of the innovation process the dual potential of a technology should be approached. The objective is to present a standardised analytical framework that allows us to study all the issues of technological duality, depending on the different actors who participate in this. This analytical framework would help to ensure the consistency of public policies of defence innovation and industrial policies by incorporating the constraints linked to the diversity of actors (of the civil and defence world, public authorities, research centres, etc.), and constraints linked to the development of a given technical system.

5It would therefore be appropriate to first distinguish the different ways of approaching duality and thus establish a typology of approaches. Then, by using this basis and mobilising systemic approaches, we will propose a global analytical framework.

Literature Review
6Since the 1980s, duality has gradually liberated itself from the simple strategy of circumventing the rules of international trade, without managing to clearly define this concept. Several authors have already worked on this concept by approaching it from different viewpoints, gradually developing this.

The Dual Object
7The first works that used the concept of dual-use technologies referred to specific technologies which, because of their characteristics, found applications in the civilian and the military field. This dissemination process moved in particular from the defence to the civilian world, what was called the spin-off paradigm by Alic et al. (1992).

8This understanding of duality focused above all on the result rather than on the process of technological rapprochement between the military field and the civilian field (Gummett, Reppy, 1998). This analysis was based on several case studies, in particular those carried out in the United States at the end of the 1980s, which identified technologies that could be transferred, most often from the military to the civilian field, but also in some cases in the other direction. Industrial sectors such as IT, electronics, or aeronautics, were particularly cited as examples in several works, such as those by Alic et al. (1992), Guichard (2004), Mérindol, Versailles (2015).

9This vision that was structured around the use of technologies largely endured in the literature beyond the 1980s. Nevertheless, few authors still believe today that this dual use is inherently linked to the nature of the technology. The idea put forward is that this duality depends, above all, on a process of appropriation by a particular social milieu (Stowsky, 2004). So there is a particular study of modes of transfer.

10This way of understanding duality refers to the ways in which objects (products and artefacts) used in one area can be adapted to others (Molas-Gallart, 1997). This poses the question of the mechanisms of technological transfer from civilian to defence (spin-in), and defence to civilian (spin-off). In this approach, the reciprocal nature of duality is highlighted much more often. The idea of a relationship between civilian and military innovation which is understood over the long term emerges, which can give rise to reversals in trends (Galbraith et al., 2004).

11Another point of view can be added to this approach, which consists in saying that, beyond the technological object itself, technology can be defined through all the knowledge which forms it (Carlsson, Stankiewicz, 1991). So studying dual technologies is like studying the dissemination of knowledge produced in the field of defence, and the similarities that can exist between this knowledge and that produced within the civilian sphere. This reinforces the idea that it is difficult to determine a priori if a technology is dual or not. So "the issue here lies (...) in the balance between specialisation and the constitution of a shared foundation of knowledge between the actors" (Mérindol, 2005, p. 52).

12In addition, observing the duality of knowledge is more awkward because it is still more difficult to define it. Here two conceptions of the duality of knowledge can be set against each other.

13The first would be to consider the duality of knowledge as a spillover (knowledge transfers), strictly speaking between the civilian and military fields, without premeditation by one or other of the fields. This vision is quite close to that proposed by Chinworth (2000) and Acosta et al. (2011).

14The second would indeed consist in considering the presence of spillovers as a consequence of the lack of duality (Cowan, Foray, 1995, p. 852). In this vision, duality lies in the co-conception of knowledge between civilian and military and the transfer is proof of the lack of co-conception. In this case, duality is input data for technological change, it assumes an evolution that, if not identical, then is at least compatible with the technical characteristics of civilian and military applications.

15Three key stages in the research allow us to move towards a systemic method to analyse knowledge in duality. First, studies at the level of firms, which point out in particular that the knowledge used by defence firms comes both from defence firms and civilian firms (Chakrabarti, Anyanwu, 1993). Then studies at the level of technologies, which seek to summarise all the links between knowledge produced in the field of defence and those produced in the military field (Acosta et al., 2011, 2013). They focus in particular on spillovers, as is the case, for Japan, in the dissertation by Chinworth (2000). Finally, case studies which try to reveal the similarities and specificities between civilian research and defence research in different technological domains (Lapierre, 2001; Acosta et al., 2017). Consequently, duality is characterised, not by transfers but by a potential co-production of knowledge and it highlights a shared foundation used by both sides (Meunier, Zyla, 2016).

16Today, defence systems have become highly complex. They combine several components organised hierarchically to produce an integrated functional system. For these Complex Product Systems (CoPS) (Hobday et al., 2005) in the defence sector, the specificity is more often at the level of system architecture than at the level of its components (Lazaric et al., 2011).

17When the prism of the production of knowledge is chosen, the time-related dynamic is also highlighted, duality should be considered from the start of a product, in other words in the research phase, and will probably end in the development phase (Gagnepain, 2001). Although duality is not a a constant phenomenon, then there is a brief dynamic during which this potential evolves (Cowan, Foray, 1995). The concept of a technological life cycle (Utterback, Abernathy, 1975) highlights two phases: experimentation then standardisation. The experimentation phase presents the greatest potential, while standardisation reduces the potential for dual use. In addition, for Cowan and Foray (1995), a product-oriented project has a lower potential for dual use because it is more limited by the specific demands of the area of application than a process-oriented project. Here, organising R&D according to the principles of duality would allow a greater number of potential applications to emerge, to delay the technological lock-in linked to standardisation, and thus to preserve technological variety (Cowan, Foray, 1995).

figure im1
18In short, for approaches focused on the technological artefact, the issue is that of technological transfer. Civilian and military uses can exist for the same technology and the objective of duality is to facilitate transfers from one sphere to the other, taking into account the problems of technological adaptation that this operation can produce. As for approaches in terms of technological systems, these refer to the innovation process and the challenge of duality is to facilitate technological co-production between the civilian and the military sphere. Transfer is no longer an issue because the defence and civilian specificities are taken into account during the innovation process

Abstract
This study aims to investigate the classification of technological innovation meta-theories based on classical texts, as well as the relationships between various classifications. Both qualitative and quantitative methods are employed. From the perspective of technological innovation, using scientometric methods, 105 pieces of classic texts from the 1930s-2010s are extracted from the references of 3862 pieces of high-quality literature from the 1900s-2020s. As a result, based on a combination of qualitative data analysis and topic model analysis, we developed a typology with eight meta-theories of technological innovation, including performance-based, resource-based, knowledge-based, capability-based, network-based, technological-innovation-system, dual-innovation, and dynamic-sustainability views. Then we analyzed 1) the evolution, reification, and confusion relationships between different meta-theories; 2) the causes of technological innovation's concept jungle; and 3) an integrated framework of technological innovation meta-theories. This study analyzed the benefits of the meta-theoretical analysis on the future study of technological innovation. Additionally, the results of this study can help to measure technological innovation, construct new theories, and improve the efficiency of the connection between the practical problems of innovation and potentially useful theoretical frameworks.
